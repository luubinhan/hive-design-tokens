# Hive design system tokesn

Hive is a design system created for SinchSMB and child products. This repository contains design tokens generated using [Figma Tokens](https://docs.tokens.studio) plugin from [Hive design file](https://www.figma.com/file/ba5gOeZ2Bb2EPFF0gAlDM5/%F0%9F%90%9D-Hive).

With help of [MkTheme tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sinchsmb/mktheme) you can convert these tokens into theme files used inside of the [Hive Components Library](https://bitbucket.org/simpletexting/ui-kit).
